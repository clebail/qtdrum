Very very small drum simulator in **LINUX** qt / rtmidi that I use to work the guitar.

## Features
* WYSIWYG loop editor
* Choosing the number of times and the number of division of time of the loop
* A human voice count every minute up to 20 (can be switched off)
* Ability to cut X Measures of N
* Start / stop the loop with a footswitch (b button by default)
* Using POSIX timer for better resolution
